# State Design Pattern

The state design pattern allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines. The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern, which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.
