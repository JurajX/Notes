# Command Design Pattern

In object-oriented programming, the command pattern uses an object to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters. I.e. it encapsulates a request as an object therby letting you parametrise other objects with different requests, queue, or log requests; and support undo operations.

This is similar to Strategy Design Pattern.
