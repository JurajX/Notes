# Bridge Design Pattern

The bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.

When there is only one fixed implementation, this pattern is known as the Pimpl idiom in the C++ world.
