# Facade Design Pattern

The facade pattern uses a facade object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code. A facade can:

- improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single (and often simplified) API
- provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality (complete with context-specific input validation)
- serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code
