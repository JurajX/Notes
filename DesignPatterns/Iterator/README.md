# Iterator Design Pattern

In object-oriented programming, the iterator design pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. I.e. it uses an iterator to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers. In some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
